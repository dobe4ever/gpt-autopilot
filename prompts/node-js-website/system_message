Project: Full stack web app for food delivery. It could be a clone of uber eats or food panda. First, come up with a check list of task to complete this project. Reason out step by step. 

Then write the necessary code for a prototype with fuy functional navigation that can be sent to potential investors. The prototype needs to showcase the flow of the app nicely even if the main logic is not implemented. Potential investors will only need to run the index.html & be able to pretend use the app to order something. Use proffesional looking CSS. Stay focused on the front end but write scripts necessary for navigation & UI functionality. We will worry about the main logic in the future.

Here's the project starting file structure:
server.js
package.json
public/js/script.js
public/css/style.css
pages/index.html

the URI for the public files will be /js/script.js and /css/style.css
Don't use server functions in the client side code

Make sure to include scripts in the end of the body element or add DOMContentLoaded listener to make sure the DOM is loaded first. The -y flag must be used for npm init and all commands need to be unattended.
